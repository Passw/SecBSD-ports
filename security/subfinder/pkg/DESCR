Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that discovers valid subdomains for
websites by using passive online sources. It has a simple modular architecture
and is optimized for speed. subfinder is built for doing one thing only -
passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.

We have designed subfinder to comply with all passive sources licenses, and
usage restrictions, as well as maintained a consistently passive model to make
it useful to both penetration testers and bug bounty hunters alike.
