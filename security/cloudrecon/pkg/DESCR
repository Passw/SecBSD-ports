CloudRecon is a suite of tools for red teamers and bug hunters to find ephemeral
and development assets in their campaigns and hunts.

Often, target organizations stand up cloud infrastructure that is not tied to
their ASN or related to known infrastructure. Many times these assets are
development sites, IT product portals, etc. Sometimes they don't have domains at
all but many still need HTTPs.
