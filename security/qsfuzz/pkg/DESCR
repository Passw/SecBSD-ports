qsfuzz (Query String Fuzz) is a tool that allows you to write simple rules in
YAML that define what value you want to inject, and what is the outcome you
expect if that injection is successful. Pass in a list of URLs, with query
strings, and qsfuzz will replace the query string values with your injections to
determine if it's vulnerable.

qsfuzz injections are done one-at-a-time for URLs with multiple query strings to
ensure requests aren't broken if certain parameters are relied on. URLs that
don't have query strings will be ignored.
