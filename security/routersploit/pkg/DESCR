The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework
dedicated for embedded devices.

It consists of various modules that aid penetration testing operations:

* exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
* creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services
* scanners - modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit
* payloads - modules that are responsible for generating payloads for 
             various architectures and injection points
* generic - modules that perform generic attacks
