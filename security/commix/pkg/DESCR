Commix (short for [comm]and [i]njection e[x]ploiter) is an automated
tool written by Anastasios Stasinopoulos (@ancst) that can be used
from web developers, penetration testers or even security researchers
in order to test web-based applications with the view to find bugs,
errors or vulnerabilities related to command injection attacks.

By using this tool, it is very easy to find and exploit a command
injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or HTTP header.
