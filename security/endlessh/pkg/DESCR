Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner.
It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time. The purpose is
to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get
stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server.

Since the tarpit is in the banner before any cryptographic exchange occurs, this
program doesn't depend on any cryptographic libraries. It's a simple,
single-threaded, standalone C program. It uses poll() to trap multiple clients
at a time.

Differences between this fork and skeeto upstream

This fork implements a better systemd service file, with support for systemctl
reload and better sandboxing. I've also unified the usage information between
the man page, readme, and actual endlessh binary.
