OWASP Joomla! Vulnerability Scanner (JoomScan)
is an open source project, developed with the aim
of automating the task of vulnerability detection
and reliability assurance in Joomla CMS deployments.

Implemented in Perl, this tool enables seamless
and effortless scanning of Joomla installations,
while leaving a minimal footprint with its lightweight
and modular architecture. It not only detects known
offensive vulnerabilities, but also is able to detect
many misconfigurations and admin-level shortcomings
that can be exploited by adversaries to compromise
the system. Furthermore, OWASP JoomScan provides
a user-friendly interface and compiles the final
reports in both text and HTML formats for ease
of use and minimization of reporting overheads.
