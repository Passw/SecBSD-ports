XSStrike is a Cross Site Scripting detection suite equipped
with four hand written parsers, an intelligent payload generator,
a powerful fuzzing engine and an incredibly fast crawler.

Instead of injecting payloads and checking it works like all
the other tools do, XSStrike analyses the response with multiple parsers
and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis
integrated with a fuzzing engine.
