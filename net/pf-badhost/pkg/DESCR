pf-badhost is a fast, bi-directional network filtering utility powered by the PF
firewall. pf-badhost blocks many of the internet's biggest irritants --
annoyances such as SSH and SMTP bruteforcers are largely eliminated. Shodan
scans and bots looking for webservers to abuse are stopped dead in their tracks.
When used to filter outbound traffic, pf-badhost blocks many seedy, spooky
malware containing web hosts.

Filtering performance is exceptional, as the badhost list is stored in a PF
table. To quote the OpenBSD FAQ page regarding tables: "the lookup time on a
table holding 50,000 addresses is only slightly more than for one holding 50
addresses."

pf-badhost is simple and powerful. The blocklists are pulled from quality,
trusted sources. The 'Spamhause', 'Firehol', 'Blocklist.de', 'Emerging Threats'
and 'Binary Defense' block lists are used as they are popular, regularly updated
lists of the internet's most egregious offenders. pf-badhost can easily be
expanded to use additional and/or alternate blocklists as well as setting custom
filter rules.
